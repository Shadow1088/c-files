This code takes log data from input file.
The input data consists of userID, Session time beginning, Session time end, and total transfer size.

The assignment is imperfect as the session duration is expected to fit within one day.

I have tried to make the code more modular than all-in-one. This does lead to certain code repetition, though it is more readable and understandable.

The result is an output file with overview of given logs.
